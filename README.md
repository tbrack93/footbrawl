# footbrawl

A turn based strategy game, based on the table top game Blood Bowl. Built as an independent University project, using a Java Spring Boot back end, HTML, CSS and JavaScript front end, WebSockets for real time communication and a MySQL database.

Originally developed using a private University gitLab account, so branches and commit data not available here.

# How to Use
The application can be used by visiting the web address www.fantasyfootbrawl.co.uk The system has been developed only for laptop or desktop computers and only tested on Chrome and Firefox.

You can choose to play against yourself by selecting ‘invite second player’ in the join game modal, using this second link in a new window. However, it is advised to do this using two different devices, or if not possible, two separate browsers. Using one device will slow down animations.

To run the application directly from the code, you can execute the FootbrawlApplication.java class within src/ main/java/com/project/footbrawl/ 

Alternatively, you can generate a jar file by installing Maven and running mvn package in the command line whilst in the project’s root directory. The application can then be run using java -jar target/footbrawl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar Onceloaded,thesystemwillbeavailablelocallyonport5000.
